# Definition: Translation refers to the process of moving a 3D object linearly from one location in the space to another without altering its orientation or size.
# Key Concepts:
# Vector Movement: The translation of an object is determined by a vector. This vector provides the direction and magnitude (distance) for the translation.
# Transformation Matrix: In linear algebra, the translation of a 3D object can be achieved using a 4x4 matrix. When this matrix multiplies the homogeneous coordinates of the object, it results in a translated object.
# Applications: Translation is often used in animations where an object needs to move from one location to another or in scenarios like camera movement in 3D visualization tools.


# The translation matrix in a 3D space is a 4x4 matrix that 
# is used to move an object to a new position in the 3D space. 
# Given a translation vector [Tx,Ty,Tz], the translation 
# matrix TT in homogeneous coordinates
