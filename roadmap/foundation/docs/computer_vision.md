# Computer Vision Basics for Visual Odometry (VO)

## Overview

This document outlines a series of projects designed to provide foundational knowledge in computer vision, essential for understanding and implementing Visual Odometry (VO).

## Projects

### Project 1: Image Processing Toolbox
- **Objective**: Develop a toolbox that can apply various image processing techniques like filtering (Gaussian, Sobel, Laplacian), edge detection, histogram equalization, morphological operations, and frequency domain transformations.
- **Skills Gained**: Familiarity with basic image processing techniques and their effects on images.

### Project 2: Feature Matching Tool
- **Objective**: Implement a tool that detects features in images using techniques like SIFT or ORB and matches them across multiple images. Introduce RANSAC for robust feature matching.
- **Skills Gained**: Understanding of feature detection, description, matching, and robust estimation techniques.

### Project 3: DIY Pinhole Camera
- **Objective**: Build a simple pinhole camera and capture images. Analyze the images to understand the pinhole camera model.
- **Skills Gained**: Practical understanding of the pinhole camera model and how 3D points are projected onto a 2D plane.

### Project 4: Camera Calibration Suite
- **Objective**: Implement a tool that can calibrate a camera using a checkerboard pattern or other known markers. Dive into intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and lens distortion correction.
- **Skills Gained**: Familiarity with camera calibration techniques and understanding of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.

### Project 5: Depth Estimation from Stereo
- **Objective**: Capture images from a stereo camera setup and implement algorithms like block matching or semi-global block matching for depth estimation from disparity.
- **Skills Gained**: Application of camera models, calibration, and feature matching to estimate depth in a scene.

### Project 6: Optical Flow Visualization
- **Objective**: Implement an optical flow algorithm to estimate motion between two consecutive frames in a video.
- **Skills Gained**: Understanding of motion estimation within frames and visualization of optical flow fields.

### Project 7: Image Stitching and Panorama Creation
- **Objective**: Stitch a series of overlapping images to create a panoramic image.
- **Skills Gained**: Application of feature matching, homography estimation, and image warping techniques.
