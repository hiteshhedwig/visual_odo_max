## What is optical flow :

Optical flow is a concept in computer vision that aims to capture the motion between two consecutive frames in a video or a sequence of images. This README provides an overview of what optical flow is, how it works, its applications, algorithms, and limitations.


#### How It Works

Optical flow works by comparing the pixel intensities of two consecutive frames to estimate the motion vectors. These vectors indicate how each pixel in the first frame has moved to produce the second frame. The result is a vector field where each vector represents the spatial displacement (both in terms of direction and distance) of a pixel or a block of pixels.

#### Mathematical Representation

Optical flow is often represented by the following equation:

\[
I(x, y, t) = I(x + dx, y + dy, t + dt)
\]

Here, \(I(x, y, t)\) is the intensity of the pixel at coordinates \((x, y)\) at time \(t\), and \(dx\), \(dy\), and \(dt\) are small changes in \(x\), \(y\), and \(t\), respectively. This equation assumes that the intensity of a moving pixel remains constant over time.

#### Applications

Optical flow has a wide range of applications:

1. **Motion Analysis**: Useful in sports, dance, or medical diagnostics.
2. **Video Compression**: Helps in predicting future frames in a video sequence.
3. **Autonomous Vehicles**: Used in navigation and obstacle avoidance.
4. **Object Tracking**: Employed in surveillance or interactive interfaces.
5. **Video Stabilization**: Helps in stabilizing shaky video footage.
6. **Augmented Reality**: Used to align and overlay virtual objects onto real-world scenes.

Various algorithms exist for computing optical flow:

1. **Lucas-Kanade Method**: Assumes constant flow in a local neighborhood.
2. **Horn-Schunck Method**: Assumes flow is smooth over the entire image.
3. **Farneb√§ck Algorithm**: Uses polynomial expansion to approximate neighborhoods.
4. **Deep Learning Methods**: Utilizes neural networks for high-accuracy estimations.

#### Limitations

1. **Illumination Changes**: Sudden changes can affect accuracy.
2. **Occlusions**: Objects hidden behind others can't be accurately computed.
3. **Complex Motions**: Some algorithms may not handle complex motions like rotational movements well.
