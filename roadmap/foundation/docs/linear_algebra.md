## Project 1: Matrix Calculator

**Objective**: Implement a calculator that can perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and inversion of matrices.

**Skills Gained**: Familiarity with matrix operations, which are fundamental for transformations in VO.

## Project 2: Eigenface Recognition

**Objective**: Use eigenvalues and eigenvectors to implement a basic face recognition system.

**Skills Gained**: Understanding of how eigen decomposition can be used in feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.

## Project 3: 3D Transformations Visualizer

**Objective**: Create a tool that allows users to apply rigid body transformations (rotation, translation, scaling) to 3D objects and visualize the results.

**Skills Gained**: Practical understanding of how transformations affect objects in 3D space.

## Project 4: Homography Estimation

**Objective**: Implement an algorithm to estimate the homography matrix between two images of a planar scene (or from different viewpoints).

**Skills Gained**: Understand the concept of projective transformations and how they relate to image warping and stitching.

## Project 5: SVD in Image Compression

**Objective**: Use SVD to compress and decompress images, observing the effects of retaining different numbers of singular values.

**Skills Gained**: Familiarity with SVD, a fundamental matrix decomposition technique.

## Project 6: Quaternion Visualizer for 3D Rotations

**Objective**: Implement a tool that allows users to represent 3D rotations using quaternions and visualize the results on 3D objects.

**Skills Gained**: Understand quaternions, an alternative to rotation matrices and Euler angles.

## Project 7: Affine and Projective Transformation Playground

**Objective**: Extend the 3D Transformations Visualizer to include affine and projective transformations on 2D images.

**Skills Gained**: Dive deeper into different types of transformations and their effects on images.
